Sussman et al. 2003,Hermodice carunculata,Amphinomidae,7,13,0,10,Bleaching,"Combined results from V. mediterranei (n = 2), V. shioli, and no infection treatments (not enough replication to break out by inoculated/non-inoculated in every study)"
Williams and Miller 2005,Coralliophila abbreviata,Muricidae,7,19,0,4,White,"Since the ""control"" they use in Table 2 is actually snails that fed on healthy corals, these ""controls"" are the nubbins that were outplanted as controls alone without snails (controls Exp III). Treatment includes experiments where snails were fed healthy corals (0 infected) and fed diseased corals (7 infected)"
Aeby and Santavy 2006,Wounding,Wounding,12,12,0,12,BBD,"Response was P. corallyticum penetrating into coral tissue (""Invaded""). See Table 1"
Aeby and Santavy 2006,Chaetodon capistratus ,Chaetodontidae,5,8,0,8,BBD,"Caging didn't have an effect (6 of 8 caged fragments were infected). It is confusing because they say ""7 of 8 were infected"" but in Table 2 it shows 5/8 for uncaged and 6/8 for caged, because both corals did not always develop disease. I went with Table 2, as it seemed more comparable, and counted each uncaged coral as an instance. Neither way seems perfect, but that seems more accurate"
Gignoux-Wolfsohn et al. 2012,Wounding,Wounding,7,39,0,30,White,"The controls are the corals from the lesion trials (15 with diseased homogenate, 15 without). These numbers include results from the first experiment (wounding results in 1/9 infected) and the two waterborned tests  where they wounded corals and either exposed them to healthy or infected water (n = 15 each)"
Gignoux-Wolfsohn et al. 2012,Coralliophila abbreviata,Muricidae,30,42,0,10,White,"Control is  from the study that also used cages (0/10 unbitted had no disease). Treatment numbers include the first experiment (starved, exposed, healthy all lumped, as long as C. abbreviata interacted [i.e. bit] the coral) and from the second experiment (C. abbreviata vs. wounding)"
Gignoux-Wolfsohn et al. 2012,Coralliophila caribea,Muricidae,0,7,0,10,White,Control is  from the study that also used cages (0/10 unbitted had no disease). Treatment numbers are from those where C. caribea fed
Nicolet et al. 2013,Drupella spp.,Muricidae,5,12,0,8,BrB,The water control is the only one counted as control (but from both experiments in Fig. 1)
Nicolet et al. 2013,Pomacentrus moluccensis,Pomacentridae,0,6,0,6,BrB,"Did not include Chromis viridis because it does not even feed on the disease band, let alone the coral"
Nicolet et al. 2013,Wounding_inoculation,Wounding,1,12,0,8,BrB,"Treatment includes that from the ""injury treatment"" and ""injury control"" (i.e. all injury). Controls are summed from both control experiments"
Nicolet et al. 2013,Chaetodon aureofasciatus,Chaetodontidae,0,6,0,6,BrB,No evidence that the fishes bit the coral but they do feed on the band so I think it makes sense to keep it given that they fed on the band and may have fed on the coral
Clemens and Brandt 2015,Coralliophila abbreviata,Muricidae,1,12,0,6,White,"See Table 1. Control is actually different than filtered (filtered is filtering diseased water, but they say that ""disease signs… were never transmitted in any control treatment""). Technically for this they used controls of a corallivore fed healthy coral but to be consistent we break it up and use the controls from the other experiment (waterborne healthy coral; Fig 2b) as controls for these and treatments as corallivore application (regardless of what they were fed before--3 ""control"" + 9 ""treatment"")"

Pratte and Richardson 2016,Cryptochiridae,Cryptochiridae,3,3,0,2,White,Removed no bite experiment (same numbers) to be consistent
Nicolet et al. 2018b,Drupella spp.,Muricidae,5,24,0,8,BrB,"We just use the water control for control. Lumped the immediate, 12 hr delay, and 24 hr delay together"
Nicolet et al. 2018b,Wounding,Wounding,0,8,0,8,BrB,"Call this the ""injury control"""

Nicolet et al. 2018b,Chaetodon plebius,Chaetodontidae,0,5,0,5,BrB,Did not include instances where butterflyfish were allowed to interact directly with the coral for consistency

Page and Willis 2008,Wounding,Wounding,0,360,0,360,SEB,"Although ciliates colonized wounds, they didn't persist/turn into tissue loss so I didn’t count it. This is from the full field experiment (in the trial exp they don't say whether injury resulted in tissue loss), where they inflicted artificial injuries on 90 branches of 4 different coral species and had the same number of controls. Also didn't include aquarium expeirment because they didn't say whether it progressed into SEB"

Katz et al. 2014,Acanthaster planci,Acanthasteridae,9,18,0,9,BrB,Lumped COTS predation + inoculation with COTS predation + no inoculation. Didn't include wounding portion because (1) mimicked storm damage/fragmentation and (2) didn't report # of fragments that sucumbed 
Miller et al. 2014,Hermodice carunculata,Amphinomidae,17,81,10,469,White,"This is just for the 21% that showed ""disease-like tissue loss"""
Randall et al. 2016,Wounding_inoculation,Wounding,0,6,0,7,DSS,"Started wound part after 5 days with no response (last experiment). Control is from the first experiment (no wounding, healthy coral -> healthy coral), and lesion treatments are combined from Exp 2"
Shaver et al. 2017,Coralliophila abbreviata,Muricidae,11,40,0,20,White,"Said they observed white symptoms on all corals that suffered full mortality so those are the ones we'll count as diseased. Results were confusing, but I think the critical part is that n = 11 snail addition (40 total with snails) corals died, which included n = 5 from snail + nutrient and n = 6 from snail only. Combined snail and snail+nutrient treatments (and across genotypes) because that's what we did with temperature studies, etc."
